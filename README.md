# My Personal Project: CPSC 210

## Emma's Travel Guide to Airlines

### Task 2

- **What will the application do?**
  
<p> This application will allow the user to create a new flight to track the list of flights that are scheduled to 
departure with specified details. Additionally, it will give the opportunity for an airline to have an organized flight 
management system to easily create, add, remove, search and view all the upcoming flights to be of a significant guide 
for travel. </p>

- **Who will use it?** 

<p> This application is open to any interested airlines that desire to enhance airline systems for the benefit of 
creating an environment of organization. <p/>

 - **Why is this project of interest to you?**

<p> This project is of interest to me because one of my aspirations in my future career is to work in the field
of airline traffic. I've always loved to travel with both my family and friends, and for most travellers, vacations 
always start on picking a destination and transportation to get there. From then on, certain sightseeing locations flow 
from there that are of interest. Therefore, with the interconnection of both my aspirations and hobbies, this
project was seemingly a perfect fit. </p>
