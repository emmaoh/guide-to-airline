# My Personal Project: CPSC 210

## Emma's Travel Guide to Airlines

### Task 2

- **What will the application do?**
  
<p> This application will show the list of flights within a certain airline that are available within the year 2022. 
Depending on the time of year, it will show the range of pric (from High to Low), and the details of the flight itself 
that is offered. </p>

- **Who will use it?** 

<p> This application is open to any interested airlines that desire to enhance airline systems for the benefit of 
creating an environment of organization. <p/>

 - **Why is this project of interest to you?**

<p> This project is of interest to me because one of my aspirations in my future career is to work in the field
of airline traffic. I've always loved to travel with both my family and friends, and for most travellers, vacations 
always start on picking a destination and transportation to get there. From then on, certain sightseeing locations flow 
from there that are of interest. Therefore, with the interconnection of both my passionate aspiration and hobbies, this
project was seemingly of perfect fit. </p>
